## Style Decisions

I decided to forgo Tailwind from v1 and instead use the same stylesheet provided by my portfolio. It is based off of Bootstrap 5. This solves a number of issues.

1. I don't have to remember multiple css styles, it is just one to handle all of my personal applications.
2. All of my personal applications look consistent.
3. Tailwind is too flexible
4. It can use a specific version that pulls from tags in GitHub when installing through `npm install`.
5. I can use the same Figma file as my portfolio as I can with Scoresheet.
