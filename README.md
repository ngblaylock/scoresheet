# Scoresheet

Scoresheet is designed and maintained by Nathan Blaylock. It began as an opportunity to learn Svelte, SvelteKit and Tailwind. Now it is frequently used by friends and family. Version 2 includes more features such as editing scores, players, graph view, and a victory podium.

The purpose of this app is to do the math for each scoring round during a card game. It is designed to be as general purpose as possible. The app is designed for mobile devices and can be "installed" by creating a shortcut on your device home screen.

This application is free to use. It doesn't cost me anything to build and maintain. My working tagline is "Add your scores without the Ads!"

Any bug fixes or suggestions can be submitted by creating an [issue onÂ GitHub](https://github.com/ngblaylock/scoresheet/issues) Or by contacting me through [my website](https://nathanblaylock.com/contact/).
