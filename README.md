# Scoresheet App

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# Use the Network option to view it on your phone

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app: `npm run build`.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deploying

On the master branch, run `npm run build` which will build to the `docs` directory. This directory in the master branch is what is live.
