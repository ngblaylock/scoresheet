# Scoresheet App

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open

# or start the server in a way you can open it on your phone
npm run dev -- --host
```

## Building

To create a production version of the app: `npm run build`.

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

## Deploying

Simply build the project, which will build to the `docs` directory. This directory in the master branch is what is live.
