# Scoresheet

Visit [https://scoresheet.nathanblaylock.com](https://scoresheet.nathanblaylock.com) for the published web app.

**Scoresheet** is designed and maintained by Nathan Blaylock. It began as an opportunity to learn Svelte, SvelteKit, and Tailwind. Since then, it has evolved away from Tailwind in favor of a personally branded CSS system built on top of Bootstrap. It is frequently used by friends and family.

Version 2 includes several new features, such as editing scores and players, a graph view, and a victory podium.

The purpose of this app is to handle the math for each scoring round during a card game. It is designed to be as general-purpose as possible. The app is optimized for mobile devices and can be "installed" by adding a shortcut to your device's home screen.

This application is free to use — it doesn’t cost me anything to build or maintain. My working tagline is: **“Add your scores without the ads!”**

Bug reports or feature suggestions can be submitted by creating an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ngblaylock/scoresheet/issues) or by contacting me through [my website](https://nathanblaylock.com/contact/).
